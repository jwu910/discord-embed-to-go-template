# Discord Embed to Go

Simple syntax converter webapp

This is a simple web ui to convert a single Discord Embed JSON into Go template syntax intended for use with [Yagpdb Bot](https://yagpdb.xyz/).

## Usage

Head to your favorite Discord Embed Builder.

1. Personal recommendation is [Discohook](https://discohook.org)
2. View your embed's JSON and copy JUST a single embed object.
   ```json
   "embeds": [
     { "title": "Your embed title" }, // <-- just one at a time
     {},
   ]
   ```
3. Go to [live site](https://jwu910.github.io/embed-to-go)
4. Paste your embed object in the first box
5. Copy and paste your output into your Yagpdb custom command
